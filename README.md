## Getting started
Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Thereby, you will need credentials for a google service account and a firebase web app.

### Configure service acccount
1. Go the dashboard for your firebase-project, and navigate to Project settings
2. Select the tab named **Service accounts**.
3. Make sure **Firebase Admin SDK** is selected, and press **Generate new private key**. This will download new credentials for a google service account.
4. Move the downloaded file to the root-directory of this project, and rename it to `firebase.config.json`.

### Configure Firebase SDK
1. Go the dashboard for your firebase-project, and navigate to Project settings
2. In the tab **General**, scroll to the section called **Your apps**.
3. Select a *Web App* and locate the code ```const firebaseConfig = {...}```
4. Copy these values to their respective fields in the `.env`-file you created. 
> **_NOTE_**: Make sure you don't have quotation-marks around the values.

Follow the steps under [Installation](#installation) and [Running the app](#running-the-app).

Once the app is running you can navigate to ```http://localhost:<SERVER_PORT>/api/docs``` for OpenApi-documentation of the endpoints.
> **_NOTE_**: `SERVER_PORT` is the value specified in your `.env`-file.
